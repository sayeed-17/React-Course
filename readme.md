<!-- #react js by namaste react


//npm means node package manager here u will be having all the packages that u need for ur project to implement and work faster.....
//packages are the piece of code which is needed for our project to run fastly
//dependencies are alo projects which our project needs...let us  say we will be having manyyyy packages in npm and we use only react,react-dom,axios packages ....and our project depends on this projects so it is called as dependencies....

//we also have bundlers...bundlers are the things which bundles the whole code to take them into the production
examples are:vite,parcel,etc....

package.json is a json file which describes about our project like what dependecies our project needs,what is the name of the project, what is the version and what are the run command scripts,...like that...

there are 2 dependcies in our package.json nrml dependenciesa nd the devtool dependencies....nrml dependencies are the ones which are used for projcect to RUNNNNN and take it to production level...whereas the dev depenciesa re the ones which are used only during development like eslint,parcel,vite etc...


PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON file consists of locked versions of dependencies we are working upon...whereas the package.json file contaiens the depencies with versions with a symbol ^ which tells that it can be updated to minor updates in that versions but says no to major update ... whereas the package lock json file locks the version...if anyone clones project the depenecy with version installed is same as that of the what is mentioned in package-lock.json....

 npm init, only package.json is created.

👉 package-lock.json is NOT created immediately.
It is automatically generated only when you install a package using npm install.
✅ npm init → Only package.json is created.
✅ npm install (first time) → Creates both package-lock.json & node_modules/.
✅ package.json lists dependencies, while package-lock.json locks exact versions.



Great question! 🚀 Since node_modules/ is not included in production, how does the code run?

📌 How React Code Runs in Production Without node_modules/?
When you run npm run build, React (via Webpack) bundles your entire app into static files inside the build/ folder. These static files do not require node_modules/ to run.

📌 What Happens During npm run build?
✅ Webpack and Babel take your React code and convert it into plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
✅ Unused dependencies from node_modules/ are removed (a process called "Tree Shaking").
✅ The final output contains only optimized files that the browser can run.

📁 Example of the build/ folder (after npm run build):

css
Copy
/build
  ├── index.html  ✅ Main HTML file  
  ├── static/
      ├── js/ ✅ Bundled and minified JavaScript  
      ├── css/ ✅ Minified CSS  
      ├── media/ ✅ Images and assets  
Everything inside the build/ folder is ready to be deployed to a server (like Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting).



📌 What Happens When You Build (npm run build)?
1️⃣ React (using Webpack) bundles only the required files into the build/ folder.
2️⃣ Unused dependencies (from node_modules/) are NOT included in the final build/ output.
3️⃣ Only the final optimized static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) are kept in the build/ folder.



📌 So How Does the Code Work in Production?
1️⃣ Your build/ folder is uploaded to a hosting service.
2️⃣ The browser loads the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from the server.
3️⃣ Since JavaScript runs in the browser, there’s no need for node_modules/ anymore! -->
